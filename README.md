# Markdown File Timeline (MFT)
Many prefer to store their notes as Markdown files in their file system. Some call that a [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/zettelkasten-improves-thinking-writing/). The tools they are using are mostly focused on editing the notes and maybe searching through them. More recent tools also provide a network view of linked notes.

But what's lacking so far is a timeline view of notes. Which notes got created (or editied) when? What's the history one's note taking?

Enter: MFT

With MFT all `.md` files in a directory tree are compiled and presented as a timeline like this:

```
$ ./mft
146 files found between 23.02.2018 and 25.08.2020

```

* Notes are presented starting from the most recent one group by day and week.
* The user can 
  * page through the notes, 
  * jump to a certain date, and 
  * open them with the preferred Markdown editor.
* Single days without files are still listed in the timeline, but several days (>7 days) without files will be replaced by `â€¦`.

# Installation

1. Install .NET Core 3.1 if it's not already on your machine. Download it for all platforms [from here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core).
2. Download the latest release ZIP-file of mft [from this repository](https://github.com/Programming-with-Ease/MarkdownFileTimeline/releases).
3. Unpack the ZIP-file where it's convenient. Maybe put it close to your note files.
4. Run the tool in a terminal/shell window: `dotnet exec mft.dll .`
   * Prepend a path to `mft.dll` if it's not in the same directory the terminal/shell is opened in.
   * Replace the `.` with a path to the root directory of your note files if they are not in the same directory as the terminal/shell is opened in.
